This is just a simple editor script for Unity which allows you to have more control over how objects are duplicated in the heirarchy.

Using this script, you can do the following with simple shortcuts:

- Duplicate an object and place it directly over the current selection (CTRL + SHIFT + O)
- Duplicate an object and place it directly under the current selection (CTRL + SHIFT + U)
- Duplicate an object and make it a child of the current selection (CTRL + SHIFT + H)

Initially created to help me while working with my own project. I haven't run into any issues with it yet, but be careful anyway.
